# Hotstring Ideas

The goal of this document is to brainstorm better Autohotkey hotstrings. 

Hotstrings using the AutoHotkey :*: syntax allows you to immediately replace what you typed with the longer, more complicated value you want printed.

This functionality has other names: Hotstrings, Text Replacement, Text Expansion, Aliasing

I actually prefer to call it text expansion for the simple use cases I have here. I think I would call them hotstrings like the AutoHotkey community if I were using it for more advanced functionality like typing a short string in order to run commands or do multiple actions. Here I am just expanding my text. 

### Text Expansions I currently use – NOTE: This document does not have correctly formatted AHK Code

zem: email

aad1: address line 1

aad2: address line 2

ccell: cell phone #

zzip: zip code

rrunserver: python manage.py runserver

ddate: current date in YYYY/MM/DD format (ex. 2023-01-21)

nnow: current datetime in YYYY/MM/DD h:mm tt format (ex. 2023-01-21 5:03 PM)

ttime: current time in h:mm tt format (5:03 PM)

## Quick and Dirty Autocorrect

Text Expansion is also good for a simple autocorrect. The English language has a LOT of corner cases when it comes to anticipating what the user deems to be “correct” for their autocorrect. I now see why not even the big tech companies can get their autocorrect right.

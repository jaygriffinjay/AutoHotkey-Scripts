I would like to add gifs to demo some functions because AutoHotkey runs off of hotkeys - i.e. something happens when you press a button. It can also function like normal programming languages when it comes to running code but the ability to quickly make buttons that run functions makes the language more physical in nature. You can also type commands anywhere in Windows in order to run commands and this is also a more tactile action than running or executing some code normally.

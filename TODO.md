## âœ” This Is A Repository Todo List

I would like to add gifs to demo some functions because AutoHotkey runs off of hotkeys - i.e. something happens when you press a button. 

It can also function like normal programming languages when it comes to running code but the ability to quickly make buttons that run functions makes the language more physical in nature. 

You can also type commands anywhere in Windows in order to run AutoHotkey commands and this is also a more tactile action than running or executing some code normally. It's kind of like aliases in Unix except now AutoHotkey can run aliases in ANY text field in ANY application rather than just using aliases in a terminal. It gives you more global control of the entire Windows GUI.
